# Detection of Abandoned Objects and Tracking of Owners for Early Warning Systems


## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the **Final project report (thesis)** for the undergraduate major project titled:

> **“Detection of Abandoned Objects, Identification and Tracking of Their Owners for Early Warning of Terror Attacks”**

The project proposes an **intelligent video surveillance pipeline** capable of:
- Detecting **static (abandoned) objects** in public spaces
- **Identifying and tracking the object’s owner**
- Classifying threat levels and raising alerts in real time

The system is designed to be **robust, computationally efficient**, and suitable for deployment on **low-power embedded systems** integrated with existing CCTV infrastructure.

## 🧠 Key Contributions

- Real-time **abandoned object detection** using foreground extraction and IOU-based static analysis  
- **Owner identification** via spatial proximity and backtracking  
- **Owner tracking** using Kalman Filters for occlusion-robust tracking  
- **Threat level classification** (attended / unattended / abandoned)  
- Optimized pipeline using **lightweight deep learning models** suitable for embedded deployment

## 🏗️ System Architecture (High Level)

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Grayscale conversion
   - Gaussian blurring for noise reduction

2. **Foreground Extraction**
   - Background subtraction
   - Canny edge detection
   - Morphological operations

3. **Static Object Detection**
   - Intersection-over-Union (IOU)–based temporal consistency check

4. **Static Object Classification**
   - MobileNet-based human vs non-human classification

5. **Owner Identification**
   - Backtracking to identify closest human when object was placed
   - YOLOv3-Tiny for fast human detection

6. **Owner Tracking**
   - Kalman Filter–based tracking across frames

7. **Alert Classification**
   - Attended
   - Unattended
   - Abandoned (alarm raised)
